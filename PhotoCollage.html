during the years we have changed some company names. It all started with Wijsmuller Salvage Salvage than in 2005 it after Svitzer (a dother company of MAERSK) the company was renamed to SvitzerWijmuller Salvage. Later on the Wijsmuller was removed and Svitzer Salvage remaind.
in 2016 ??? company mearged with TITAN and became ARDENT. In 2020 the company could not continue with her current setup and was sold in pieces to different salvage companies around the world.
