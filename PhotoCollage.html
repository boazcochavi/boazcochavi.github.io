this area contains phots of our colleagues and projects of hystiorical importance.
during the years we have changed some company names. It all started with Wijsmuller Salvage. In 2005, after Svitzer (a daughter company of MAERSK) took the company over, the company was renamed SvitzerWijmuller Salvage. Later on the Wijsmuller was removed and Svitzer Salvage remaind.
In 2016 ??? company mearged with TITAN and became ARDENT. In 2020 the company could not continue with her current setup and was sold in pieces to different salvage companies around the world.

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:
